## About Me  
I’m a third-year undergraduate at UC San Diego exploring the intersection of machine learning and cognitive neuroscience.
My work involves applying computational methods to analyze biological data and build systems that enhance human cognition and decision-making.
I focus on clean design, reproducible workflows, and connecting theoretical principles with practical applications.

## Featured Project  
### [TH Intensity Measurement](https://github.com/ZhuoxiChen09/th-intensity-measurement)  
A Java + ImageJ workflow automating the quantification of **tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) intensity** in MitoPark mouse brain slices.  
- Standardizes ROI placement and scale calibration  
- Supports manual ROI adjustment for precision  
- Exports data in structured CSV format for statistical analysis  
> Developed for dopaminergic neuron degeneration research in the UCSD Leutgeb Lab.

## Concept Design Work  
In addition to research and engineering, I also design early-stage system concepts and user flows grounded in cognitive science.  
My recent work includes the **NoCrastination** concept prototype, which explores how UI structure, cognitive offloading, and attention-guidance principles can improve focus and task planning.
