## About Me  
I’m a third-year undergraduate at UC San Diego exploring the intersection of machine learning and cognitive neuroscience.  
My work involves applying computational methods to analyze biological data and build systems that enhance human cognition and decision-making.  
I focus on clean design, reproducible workflows, and connecting theoretical principles with practical applications.

## Projects

### [TH Intensity Measurement](https://github.com/ZhuoxiChen09/th-intensity-measurement)  
A Java-based ImageJ plugin for semi-automated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) signal intensity measurement from brain slice images.
- Standardizes ROI placement and scale calibration  
- Supports manual ROI adjustment for precision  
- Exports data in structured CSV format for statistical analysis  
> Developed for dopaminergic neuron degeneration research in the UCSD Leutgeb Lab.

### [Spotify Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/ZhuoxiChen09/spotify-popularity-prediction)  
Machine learning project comparing KNN regression models to predict song popularity rankings using streaming platform metrics.
- Systematic model evaluation with cross-validation and bias-variance analysis
- Analyzes relationship between music metrics (streams, playlists, views) and song popularity
- Best model achieves 65% variance explanation with distance-weighted KNN (k=5)

### [mini-rag](https://github.com/ZhuoxiChen09/mini-rag)  
A compact Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demonstration embedding local text files and answering questions using instruction-tuned language models.
- Embeds `.txt` files and builds retrieval indices
- Interactive query loop with context-aware generation
- Minimal, reproducible implementation ready for local experimentation

## Concept Design

In addition to research and engineering, I design early-stage system concepts and user flows grounded in cognitive science.

### [NoCrastination — Concept Design](https://github.com/ZhuoxiChen09/NoCrastination-Concept)  
A productivity assistant concept inspired by cognitive science, behavioral psychology, and human-centered design.
- Reduces decision fatigue through cognitive offloading and attention guidance
- Early UI screens, user flow concepts, and system architecture
- Integrates principles like task chunking and temporal motivation theory
- Visual identity and product direction documentation
